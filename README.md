### Hi there! 👋 I'm Barock

Head of Engineering at Gojek, started as a web developer when Web 2.0 was all the rage. Over time, my roles have evolved alongside my passion for technology and teamwork.

#### 💻 Tech Journey
From software engineer to tech lead, and now to an engineering manager, each step in my journey has taught me something new about creating software and leading teams.

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team Player
I get a real kick out of collaborating with other tech enthusiasts. It's the people that make tech exciting!

#### 🌄 Beyond Code
Off-duty, I swap code for wilderness, either hiking alone or hitting the road with my family for our epic road trips. It's all about balance.

#### 📖 On GitHub
Take a look around my GitHub to see what I've been up to. Reach out for collaboration or just to chat tech!
